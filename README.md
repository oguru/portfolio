# Portfolio

## Description
My personal portfolio page I created in Html, Sass and Javascript to demonstrate my web development abilities along with projects I have worked on.\
I applied myself to give as much attention to detail as possible and make the site pleasing to the eye and to interact with.

## Still To Do
* Fix minor bugs with navbar.
* Fix blog animation when it is closed mid transition.
* Refactor code to improve performance and make it more legible.
  * Try changing border shadow size changes to opacity.
  * Change movement animation from position to transform: translate.
* Implement animations in more places.
* Make site more accessible for screen readers.
* Improve layout of the projects and blog pages.
* Implement pull down nav on mobile rather than click.

## Setup
1 - Clone the repository.\
2 - Open index.html in your browser.


## Built Using
