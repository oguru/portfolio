    <p>I am a junior software developer at the end of a 12 week front end developer course with _nology, and I
        never had any idea that programming could be so awesome.</p>
    <p>The idea that you can imagine something, and then write a long sequence of what used to look like an
        alien language so
        that you can literally give instructions to a machine to bring it to life is insane!</p>
    <p>My work history is quite a varied one. I have had a variety of jobs, not really knowing exactly what I
        wanted to do.</p>
    <p>I enjoyed learning some QBasic and writing text based games as a child and decided that I wanted to be a
        programmer when
        I grew up. However, I was always told I would need to study high level Mathematics to do so and that
        programming
        was boring, and I drifted away from the idea.</p>
    <p>My interest was sparked again last year and I decided to try and learn some C, which was challenging but
        enjoyable. Once I realised bootcamps existed, that you don't need a Maths degree and that I could
        actually pursue a career in development, I moved to Bristol to start a new chapter of my life and do the
        course, and I haven't looked back
        since.</p>
    <p>I never imagined that I could enjoy something so much that putting endless
        hours of learning into it doesn't feel like work. I just wish there were more hours in the day so I
        could !</p>
    <p>People always say to find work that you enjoy. Before I was merely working to live. I know that I am now
        back on the right path for me and am looking forward to bringing many ideas to life.</p>
